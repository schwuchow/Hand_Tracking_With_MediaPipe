# Hand_Tracking_With_MediaPipe

## STEP 1
Create a sphere prefab with scale (10,10,10)

## STEP 2
Copy paste the code into your project, namely MediapipeUnity/Samples/Scenes/HandTracking. There should be files with the same name

## STEP 3
The Solution GameObject needs the sphere prefab and the Annotatable Screen which you can find in MainCanvas/Container Panel/Body
Then some params need to be set. I took the params from the example in the github project which are:
width = 640
height = 480
fps = 30

## That should do it
